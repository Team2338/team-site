						Our electrical subteam connects all of our other
						subteams providing aid on any project with wiring.
						Throughout the season, students learn about soldering,
						circuit boards, resistors, pneumatics, connection types,
						circuitry planning, and so much more. Through
						prototyping our Outreach (AE: adaptive toys, CHUCK, and
						other small projects), students are able to apply their
						newly found knowledge in ways that matter. All of this
						practice leads us to well executed, well-organized &
						tracable wiring, along with secure pneumatics, that make
						our robot function at its fullest potential.{" "}
