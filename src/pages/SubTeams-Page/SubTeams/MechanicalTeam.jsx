                        Students go through tool and safety training to insure that our shop remains productive and safe. 
                        Our design work is done in CAD software, usually Autodesk Inventor. 
                        Working with the Electrical and Programing subteams allows us to quickly and confidently field a world class competition bot every year.</p>
