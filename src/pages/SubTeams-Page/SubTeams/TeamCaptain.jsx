                            The Team Captain also plays the role of helping schedule events for the team. 
                            By taking on the role equivalent to a CEO, the Team Captain does what needs to be done and what the Team Leaders don't. 
                            Becoming a Team Captain is a difficult task, requiring friendly competing with your fellow teamates and sending in a resume. 
                            However, becoming a Team Captain is a worthwhile job, letting you help aid the team and community in many ways.
