							Our Team Leaders lead our team. By having one Team
							Leader per subteam (AE: Electrical, Marketing,
							Programming, etc.) we can maintain a streamlined and
							safe enviroment while working on the bots. Our Team
							Captains also insure that we have everything
							completed by the due date. Becoming a Team Leader is
							a lot of work, and requires dedication. However it
							is worth it as the students get to experience what
							it is like to be a company manager and similar jobs
							early on.
