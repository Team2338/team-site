						Our outreach subteam uses our robotics skills to better
						the community, for example soldering easy-press buttons
						onto toys for kids that might not be able to play
						without them. Additionally, we design and engineer a
						kickball device called CHUCK (Community-Helping Utility
						Companion for Kickball). This device allows every kid,
						regardless of situation, to participate in many fun
						games. On top of that, each month we make and deliver
						STEM kits to underrepresented schools with the goal of
						making sure every child gets to experience STEM. The
						main star of Outreach however, is our yearly Impact
						(FKA, ChairmanÂ´s) Essay. For this we create an essay,
						video, and presentation about our Impact on the
						community.
